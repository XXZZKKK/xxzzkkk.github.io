Xzk, no screen name, Shanghai East China University of Science and Technology undergraduate studying, professional like half physics and half chemistry, but still prefer some physics, device physics good :). 

Hobbies: usually like to play games: a wide range of fps, rpg, roguelike, soullike; watch some anime, personal taste is relatively picky, the painting style and plot requirements of high, and see the love of tomatoes is relatively small. Moderate music lover, mainly listen to Japanese female voice, game, anime OST, piano, violin. Chinese and English songs are seldom contacted, because sometimes I will listen to songs and read books, and if I play songs that I can understand the lyrics, it will affect my thinking. ...... Pure music and Japanese, not so much. 

I'll update it when I think of it afterward XD
